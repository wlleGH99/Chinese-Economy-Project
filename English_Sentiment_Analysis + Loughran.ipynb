       "       'Chinese tourism blow as PM slams racism\\nAustralian Chamber of Tourism chairman John Hart says the Chin\\xadese tourism market, which contributes $711m a week on average to the economy, has effectively “come to a dead stop” after the corona\\xadvirus outbreak prompted the government to shut its borders.\\nMr Hart said the loss of the Chin\\xadese market was a double blow after a horror bushfire season that had impacted on international tourism, as imagines of the inferno were broadcast across the world.It comes after the Chief Medical Officer raised concerns on Tuesday about xenophobia and racial profiling in Australia as a result\\xad of the outbreak, and Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese both urged Australians to “stand up and speak out” against racism after restaurants and shops run by Chinese-Australians reported a reduction in customers over recent\\xad weeks. The Prime Minister said parliament “stands as one” on the issue of supporting the Chin\\xadese-Australian community.\\n“This is a very significant challenge and the Chinese-Australian community has risen to that challenge — they deserve our great \\xadappreciation and support,” he said.\\nThe Opposition Leader said Chinese-Australians had been undeservedly targeted as a result of the virus. “The fact is, any racism behaviour will not be tolerated and must be called out,” he said. “All of us must stand up and speak out against ugly, divisive and racism behaviour … directed to some of our fellow Australians.” “It’s pretty concerning,” Mr Hart said of the reduction in Chin\\xadese tourism. “Especially because the Chinese market should be \\xaddelivering even more than that avera\\xadge at the moment because we are in peak tourist season with the middle of the Chinese New Year. Having lost the peak of our holiday season to the bushfires, we are now losing the peak of the Asian tourism season.” Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk raised concerns in parliament last week that the economic loss to tourism operators in the state could soar to $400m. “The top 10 operators report a 15 per cent to 20 per cent drop in trade,” she said. “This affects 3500 businesses and 42,000 jobs. In far north Queensland, estimates are local businesses are losing around $5.5m a day. As much as $350m could be lost by March.” Mr Hart said some businesses such as Chinese-language tours were particularly affected. “The Gold Coast, Cairns and Tasmania, where many of these Chinese-languag\\xade tours are very popular, is where they are going to be doing it really tough,” he said.\\nChief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said on Tuesday: “We are very concerned about xenophobia and any sort of racial profiling, which is completely abhorrent.\\n“There’s no reason for people to avoid anybody of any particular background or appearance,” Dr Murphy said.\\nHe was flanked by federal Health Minister Greg Hunt, who said the evacuees on Christmas Island\\xad would have a final health check before leaving the island next week after spending 14 days in quarantine. “They will be able to go home, subject to having a very clear process of having been checked and been declared \\xaddisease-free,” he said.\\nThere have been 15 confirmed cases in Australia, with five recovering and the other 10 in isolation and in a stable condition.Meanwhile, 11 of the 229 Australians on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan have been diagnosed with coronavirus and given medical treatment on land by Japanese authorities.',\n",
       "       'China growth the slowest since 1990\\nChinese economic growth slowed to 6.1 per cent last year, according to figures released Friday, as sagging trade and business confidence pulled the closely watched reading to its lowest level in nearly three decades.\\nThe slowdown, which has become more severe since the economy peaked in 2011 following years of double-digit growth, rippled through many sectors of the Chinese economy last year and was made worse by the Trump administration’s trade pressure and tariffs.Even so, the growth rate of 6.1 per cent, down from a revised 6.6 per cent rate for 2018, fell within the government’s target of 6 per cent to 6.5 per cent for 2019. China’s official statistics bureau described the national economy as being “generally stable” last year.\\nBeijing’s main development targets were met, the National Bureau of Statistics said in its economic report on Friday, which “laid a solid foundation for completing the building of a moderately prosperous society” — a favoured term of President Xi Jinping to describe his goal of building a solid middle class.\\nThe continuing downshift wasn’t unexpected, given how large China’s economy had become. But it also reflects the degree to which debt helped fuel China’s extraordinary growth. Beijing continued its campaign against high debt levels last year, with some success.\\nTrade tensions with the US also damaged China’s business confidence throughout the year. Economists say China’s economy will benefit only to a limited degree from a trade agreement signed by the two countries this week.\\nIncomes grew more slowly than the economy did last year at 5.8 per cent, while rising inflation — made worse by higher pork prices — crimped purchasing power. An outbreak of African swine fever roughly doubled the price of pork at certain points during the year as the virus forced farmers to cull at least a quarter of the nation’s hog population.\\nPork is the most consumed meat in China.Dow Jones Newswires',\n",
       "       'Iron ore’s $100bn export boom\\nIron ore is projected to be Australia’s first commodity to top $100bn of export earnings in a single year, as the nation’s biggest exporters shrug off a global market meltdown to cash in on Chinese \\xaddemand, government forecasts predict.\\nThe steelmaking raw material has continued to trade near $US90 a tonne despite the coronavirus sparking a broader market rout. Its high prices, along with a boost in supply to 877 million tonnes, could see Australia reap a 28 per cent annual lift in iron ore earnings to $101bn in 2019-20.Longer-term iron ore volumes from Australia could sail just under the one billion tonne level by 2024-25, although an expected retreat in prices over the next few years will see earnings decline to $69bn by that stage.\\nAustralia’s combined mining and energy exports are set to rise to $299bn in 2019-20, from $281bn, with a lower than expected Australian dollar and increases in iron ore and gold outweighing softer earnings from coal and LNG.\\nWhile the official government forecasts warn the earnings estimates could change due to the coronavirus pandemic, it still \\xadexpects demand to rebound in China, Australia’s biggest commodity buyer.\\n“The number of new cases has now peaked in China, and it seems like that, as factories restart, Chinese activity will quickly \\xadrebound,” the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources said in its report for the March quarter. “It is assumed that the overwhelming majority of work places in China will be fully operational by the end of June 2020.” Annual GDP growth in China will “drift lower”, remaining above 5 per cent, although efforts by multinationals to cut their reliance on the world’s biggest economy in their supply chains could see forecasts change.\\nIron ore stocks at ports in China are running at about 120 million tonnes, down from record highs of just over 160 million tonnes two years ago, with Australia’s big three exporters Rio Tinto, BHP and Fortescue Metals Group shipping strong volumes.\\nChallenges remain for other commodities more exposed to market volatility. The oil price crash, and knock-on effect on the LNG sector whose prices are linked to crude, will see the value of Australia’s LNG \\xadexports fall to $49bn in 2019-20, from $51bn a year earlier, and then fall to $44bn in 2020-21.\\n“While Asian LNG spot prices are forecast to recover from the current record lows, ongoing overcapacity in global LNG markets is expected to constrain the extent of any price recovery over the next two years,” the report noted. The government forecaster expects oil prices to average $US60 a barrel in 2020, which may prove optimistic with the \\xadrecent Saudi-Russia supply war seeing prices plummet to just $US30 a barrel.\\nAustralia is also on track to overtake China as the world’s largest gold producer in 2021 as high prices boost production. The value of gold exports is forecast to soar to $26bn in 2019-20 on higher prices and volumes before declining to $21bn in 2024-25.\\n“The low interest rate environment is likely to continue to be a major factor driving institutional investment demand for gold. With real interest rates remaining low in historical terms, the opportunity cost of holding gold is low, raising its attractiveness as an investment asset in times of uncertainty,” the report said. “The gold price could exceed expectations in the short term if the COVID-19 outbreak turns out to have a larger than expected adverse impact on the world economy.”Resources Minister Keith Pitt said he was focused on ensuring the commodities sector continued to thrive. “The best thing that we as a government can do is to remove any red and green tape that will stifle investment and ensure that our policy settings and actions for managing challenges like COVID-19 are right,” Mr Pitt said.'],\n",
